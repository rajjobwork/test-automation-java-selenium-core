# test-automation-java-selenium-core
Overview

The Test automation uses a mix of the core java library and the testing template repositories. We have 2 different template repositories.One is for TestNG and the other one is for cucumber.
This solution can be used for automating the test cases using selenium Java.
In addition to sequential execution, the solution also provides support for parallel testing as well as cross-browser testing.
The core java library is converted into a jar file and used as a dependency in the template pom.xml file.

##Whatâ€™s Included?
1. Parallel test execution, thus saving time
2. The ability to run test suites in multiple browsers for cross-browser testing.
